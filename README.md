# Labelling Chest Xrays
![Chest_Xrays](chest_xrays.jpg)

## 1. Intro to the problem/Background
- To identify Chest Xrays as having pneumonia or not, there's need to be a radiologist and specialists before the decisions is made. Therefore, having an automated Cloud system that is able to provide second opninion in a timely manner will speed up the workflow efficiency bring in a lot of benefits.

- Chest X-rays images (anterior-posterior) were selected from restrospective cohorts of pediatrics patients of 1 to 5 years olf from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

## Data Source:
- **Dataset**: [Chest X-Ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

- **Description**: The dataset is originally organized into 3 folders (train, test, and val) and each of them contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). However, for the sake of simplicity and since the val folder only have 8 images for each subfolder, I'll only include 2 folders (train and test) for this project.
